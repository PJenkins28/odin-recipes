  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
      <li>Make the meat sauce. Add beef and sausage to a large skillet over medium-high heat, 
        breaking it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the onion and garlic. Cook until meat is browned, 
        about 6-8 minutes. Drain the fat from the meat. Return the meat to the skillet.</li>
      <li>Add the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, sugar, 2 teaspoons salt, 
        2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon basil, and the black pepper. Stir until well 
        combined. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer the sauce for 30 minutes. Stir in 2 
        tablespoons of the minced parsley.</li>
      <li>As the sauce cooks, make the ricotta mixture. In a large bowl, add 1 cup mozzarella, 
        the ricotta, ¼ cup parmesan, 2 tablespoons of the parsley, the egg, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 
        teaspoon Italian seasoning, and ½ teaspoon basil. Stir until well incorporated.</li>
      <li>Cook the pasta al dente, according to it's package directions.</li>
      <li>Assemble the lasagna. In a 13x9 inch baking dish, add a very thin layer of meat sauce 
        (about 1/4 cup). Layer 3 lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta mixture, and 1 1/2 (level) cups 
        of meat sauce. Repeat the layers twice.</li>
      <li>Add a final layer of the remaining noodles, meat sauce, 1 cup mozzarella, and 1/4 cup parmesan.</li>
      <li>Cover with foil that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Bake for 45 minutes. Remove 
        the foil. Bake 15 more minutes.</li>
      <li>Let the lasagna cool for 15-20 minutes before cutting.</li>
